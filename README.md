# ProfanityBot
This is a bot to prevent the use of profanity in our Discord.
#### NOTE
This is just the code only! You'll need the ProfanityBot Token in order for this program to work properly. That means if you want to edit the existing bot on the DG Discord, you'll need to contact on the Development Team Members.

### Project setup 
You'll need to install the requirements.txt for the project.
```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after that, your good to go!
